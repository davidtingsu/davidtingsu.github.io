My motivation to document my milestones began one day on Quora when I came across Karen Cheng’s response to ‘How do you get a job as a designer without going to design school?’, and her other online pursuits such as Giveit100 and her viral ‘Girl learns to Dance in a Year’ video. Ultimately, I was and am convinced that to increase my proactiveness will lead to a better me in 2014.
